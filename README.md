## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

# Running Tauri and Python Servers

This guide explains how to set up and run both a Tauri application and a Python server on macOS with proper logging.

## Prerequisites

- macOS operating system
- Node.js and npm installed
- Python 3.x installed
- Tauri development environment set up
- Git (optional, for version control)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts.

## Make Scripts Executable

After creating these scripts, make them executable:

```bash
chmod +x run_servers.sh monitor_logs.sh stop_servers.sh
```

## Directory Structure

Ensure your project follows this structure (modify paths in scripts if different):

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tauri-app/         # Your Tauri application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ python-server/     # Your Python server
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.py      # Main Python server file
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/              # Created automatically to store logs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_servers.sh     # Script to start both servers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monitor_logs.sh    # Script to view logs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stop_servers.sh    # Script to stop servers
```

## Usage

1. **Start both servers**:
   ```bash
   ./run_servers.sh
   ```

2. **Monitor logs in real-time**:
   ```bash
   ./monitor_logs.sh
   ```

3. **Stop all servers**:
   ```bash
   ./stop_servers.sh
   ```

## Logging Configuration

## Troubleshooting

- **Scripts not executing**: Ensure they have executable permissions with `chmod +x *.sh`
- **Paths not found**: Update the directory paths in the scripts to match your project structure
- **No logs appearing**: Check that the logs directory exists and has write permissions
- **Servers not stopping**: Use `ps aux | grep python` or `ps aux | grep tauri` to find processes manually, then kill them

## Notes

- Customize the scripts for your specific server configurations
- For production deployments, consider using process managers like PM2 or supervisor
- These scripts are designed for development environments on macOS

# Api Tool Ideas

### Why

1. There are tools like postman but they are prety slow and are hard to manage
2. Creating an environment and is hard and not realy very intutive
3. There is not team sharing for free
4. No feature available to save the request and response
5. No Feature to test random API without saving them
6. No automatic support for creating a body and autofills
7. Postmans fake data generator is decent but dont like it much
8. So support for SOAP API

9. Low support for API documentation

## Ideas

1. Add a proxy support
2. Add feature like swagger ui for API documentation
3. Team Collaboration for free
4. Rest, GraphQL, XML and Soap, gRPC and WebSocket add support for these
5. **Cloud and Offline storage is supported**
6. **State-of-art authorization support.**  Supports OAuth2, Basic Auth, Bearer Token, and API Key authorization.
7. Make a flow runner with which you can determine which api to run first and complete the flow
8. Unique features such as **multi-step requests**, Actions, Functions, and no-code API testing.
9. Offer Git sync
10. Scripting capabilities that allow you to write Javascript code to modify requests, access responses, set variables or send requests.
11. Add a CLI feature
12. Add a copy API log feature
13. You can manage you environment from anywhere and dont have to change tab

1. **AI-Powered API Testing**

    * Auto-generate test cases from API responses.
    * AI suggestions for missing parameters & incorrect API usage.
    * Auto-fix common API errors.
2. **One-Click API Mocking**

    * Instantly mock APIs with dynamic responses (like wiremock but easier).
    * Define rules for different responses (e.g., simulate 500 errors for testing).
3. **Database Integration**

    * Directly query databases (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL) from the API tester.
    * Verify API responses against expected database states.
4. **Auto-Healing API Tests**

    * When an API structure changes, auto-adjust test cases instead of failing them.
5. **Load &amp; Performance Testing**

    * Send thousands of requests per second to stress-test APIs.
    * Generate detailed latency & performance reports.
6. **Swagger/OpenAPI Import &amp; Export**
