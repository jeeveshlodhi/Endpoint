## Overview

Endpoint is a powerful, open-source API testing tool built with Tauri, React, and TypeScript. It combines the speed and efficiency of native applications with the flexibility of modern web technologies to deliver a superior API testing experience.

## Why Endpoint?

<!-- What problems does Endpoint solve? -->

Traditional API testing tools have several limitations that Endpoint addresses:

1. **Performance Issues**: Most existing tools are either browser-based or Electron applications that consume excessive resources. Endpoint's Tauri foundation provides native performance with minimal resource usage.

2. **Complex Environment Management**: Setting up and switching between environments is cumbersome in many tools. Endpoint offers intuitive environment management that's accessible from any context.

3. **Limited Team Collaboration**: Free tiers of existing tools often restrict collaboration features. Endpoint provides robust team collaboration capabilities at no cost.

4. **Poor Data Persistence**: Many tools don't properly save request and response data. Endpoint automatically preserves your testing history.

5. **Unintuitive Interfaces**: Traditional tools often have steep learning curves. Endpoint focuses on user experience with a clean, intuitive interface that both beginners and experts can master quickly.

6. **Weak Documentation Support**: API documentation often feels like an afterthought. Endpoint integrates documentation directly into your workflow with auto-generation capabilities.

7. **Limited Protocol Support**: While REST APIs are well-supported elsewhere, Endpoint extends full support to GraphQL, WebSockets, gRPC, and SOAP APIs in a unified interface.

## 💡 Innovative Ideas Being Developed

<!-- Forward-looking features and ideas -->

We're constantly pushing the boundaries of what an API testing tool can do. Here are some innovative features on our roadmap:

### Performance Analysis & Load Testing
- **Real-time Performance Metrics**: Monitor response times, throughput, and error rates as you test
- **Distributed Load Testing**: Simulate thousands of users accessing your API simultaneously
- **Performance Regression Detection**: Automatically identify when API performance degrades across versions
- **Geographic Testing**: Test API performance from multiple global regions

### AI-Powered API Intelligence
- **Smart API Mocking**: Generate realistic mock responses based on previous API behavior
- **Test Generation**: Create comprehensive test suites with a single click
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual API responses that might indicate bugs
- **Natural Language Querying**: Write API requests using everyday language

### Advanced Collaboration Features
- **API Design Reviews**: Built-in workflows for reviewing and approving API changes
- **Synchronous Editing**: Google Docs-style collaborative editing of requests and tests
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Integrated wiki for team documentation linked directly to API resources
