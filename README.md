# Tauri + React + Typescript

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, React and Typescript in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

# Api Tool Ideas

### Why

1. There are tools like postman but they are prety slow and are hard to manage
2. Creating an environment and is hard and not realy very intutive
3. There is not team sharing for free
4. No feature available to save the request and response
5. No Feature to test random API without saving them
6. No automatic support for creating a body and autofills
7. Postmans fake data generator is decent but dont like it much
8. So support for SOAP API

9. Low support for API documentation

## Ideas

1. Add a proxy support
2. Add feature like swagger ui for API documentation
3. Team Collaboration for free
4. Rest, GraphQL, XML and Soap, gRPC and WebSocket add support for these
5. **Cloud and Offline storage is supported**
6. **State-of-art authorization support.**  Supports OAuth2, Basic Auth, Bearer Token, and API Key authorization.
7. Make a flow runner with which you can determine which api to run first and complete the flow
8. Unique features such as **multi-step requests**, Actions, Functions, and no-code API testing.
9. Offer Git sync
10. Scripting capabilities that allow you to write Javascript code to modify requests, access responses, set variables or send requests.
11. Add a CLI feature
12. Add a copy API log feature
13. You can manage you environment from anywhere and dont have to change tab

1. **AI-Powered API Testing**

    * Auto-generate test cases from API responses.
    * AI suggestions for missing parameters & incorrect API usage.
    * Auto-fix common API errors.
2. **One-Click API Mocking**

    * Instantly mock APIs with dynamic responses (like wiremock but easier).
    * Define rules for different responses (e.g., simulate 500 errors for testing).
3. **Database Integration**

    * Directly query databases (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL) from the API tester.
    * Verify API responses against expected database states.
4. **Auto-Healing API Tests**

    * When an API structure changes, auto-adjust test cases instead of failing them.
5. **Load &amp; Performance Testing**

    * Send thousands of requests per second to stress-test APIs.
    * Generate detailed latency & performance reports.
6. **Swagger/OpenAPI Import &amp; Export**

    * Import Swagger & OpenAPI specs to generate requests automatically.
    * Export API requests as OpenAPI definitions.
7. **AI-Powered API Documentation**

    * Auto-generate human-friendly API docs based on requests & responses.
8. **Faster UI with Less Bloat**

    * Postman is heavy. Build a lightweight, high-performance alternative.
9. **Custom Workflows &amp; API Chaining**

    * Chain API requests with logic (If API-1 fails, send API-2).
    * Drag-and-drop workflow builder for API sequences.
10. **Git Integration**

* Save & sync API collections to GitHub/GitLab.
* View diffs between API versions.

11. **Security Testing**

* Scan for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS in API responses.
* Auto-detect security misconfigurations.

12. **Real-Time Collaboration**

* Live collaboration (Google Docs-style) for editing API requests.

13. **Version Control for APIs**

* Track changes in API structure & compare previous versions.
* Roll back to previous versions easily.

14. **VS Code Plugin / Browser Extension**

* Bring API testing inside the IDE.
* A lightweight Chrome/Firefox extension for quick API calls.

15. **Integrated API Monitoring Dashboard**

* Monitor API uptime, response times, error rates, and status trends.
* Alerts when APIs fail.

16. **Native Mobile App**

* Postman’s mobile app is weak. Build a full-fledged API tester for mobile.

17. **Custom Scripting with Python &amp; JavaScript**

* Allow test scripts in Python, not just JavaScript.

18. **End-to-End API Testing with Frontend Integration**

* Test APIs and UI flows together (e.g., test login API & verify front-end response).

19. **Offline Mode**

* Work without an internet connection & sync changes later.

### **1️⃣ Performance &amp; Load Testing (From K6, JMeter)**

* **Simulate heavy traffic** (thousands of concurrent users).
* **Latency &amp; throughput analysis** (response time metrics).
* **Stress testing** (test how API behaves under extreme conditions).
* **Spike testing** (sudden traffic surges).

###

### **API Gateway &amp; Proxy Features (From Kong, Apigee)**

* **Intercept &amp; modify API requests**.
* **Request &amp; response transformation** (edit API responses on the fly).
* **Rate limiting &amp; throttling tests**.
* **API traffic monitoring &amp; analytics**.

### **4️⃣ AI-Powered Test Automation (From RapidAPI, Postbot)**

* **AI-generated test cases** based on API responses.
* **Self-healing tests** (automatically fix breaking API tests).
* **Intelligent API usage suggestions** (suggest missing headers, parameters).
* **AI-generated API documentation**.

### **Multi-Protocol Support (From SoapUI, Insomnia)**

* **WebSocket &amp; GraphQL testing**.
* **gRPC API support**.
* **Kafka &amp; MQTT messaging API support**.
* **SOAP API testing with WSDL parsing**.

###

### **Native CI/CD Integration (From RestAssured, Newman, K6)**

* **Run tests in Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD**.
* **Generate detailed test reports (JSON, HTML, CSV)** .
* **Fail-fast mechanism** (if an API fails, stop deployment).

###

### **9️⃣ Contract &amp; Schema Validation (From Pact, OpenAPI)**

* **Contract testing** (verify API responses against OpenAPI/Swagger specs).
* **Schema validation** (ensure API responses follow a defined structure).
* **Consumer-driven contract testing** (ensure compatibility between microservices).

###

### **Local &amp; Cloud Syncing (From Hoppscotch, Insomnia)**

* **Cloud syncing across devices**.
* **Offline mode with auto-sync** when online.
* **Encrypted storage for API credentials &amp; secrets**.
